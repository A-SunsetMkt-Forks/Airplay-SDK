## Use Cases
- Meeting Room Collaboration: The SDK enables presenters to control presentations while moving freely, fostering more audience interaction, rather than being tethered to a laptop connected to the large screen. Mobile displays can also be broadcast during video conferences or webinars using this technology.

- Education: The SDK can be used to share content from Apple devices in the classroom. This allows instructors to walk around the room during demonstrations, and students can present their work to the entire class using this technology. The password protection feature restricts unauthorized access.

- Home Entertainment: The SDK allows users to stream stored videos, songs, and YouTube free content directly to a receiver device over Wi-Fi. It also facilitates easy viewing of photos and videos on a large screen during gatherings with family and friends.

- Car Infotainment: The SDK allows for wireless screen sharing, playback of audio/video/movies, and photo slideshows from iOS/Mac devices to Android/Embedded Linux-based car infotainment units for viewing by all occupants. This transforms the car into a mobile presentation space, where iOS users can control presentations on the car's display directly from their iOS device.
